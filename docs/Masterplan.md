# My Application Tracker – Masterplan

## Vision

My Application Tracker helps job seekers manage the often-overwhelming process of applying to multiple roles by keeping all related information — resumes, cover letters, job descriptions, contacts, and follow-ups — organized in one place. By centralizing this data and eventually enhancing it with AI tools for interview prep and career development, the app aims to become an essential assistant throughout the job search journey.

## Goals

1. Enable users to track all job applications in one streamlined dashboard.
2. Help job seekers stay organized and improve their follow-up process with potential employers.
3. Launch a 30-day beta trial and recruit at least 100 users for initial testing and feedback.

## Success Metrics

- Number of beta users acquired within 30 days.
- Percentage of users actively using the tracker after one week and at the end of the trial.
- Conversion rate from beta testers to paid subscribers post-trial.
- Average number of jobs tracked per user.

## Target Users

- Recent college graduates applying to their first jobs.
- Laid-off tech professionals navigating a competitive job market.
- Career switchers looking to break into a new field with tailored applications.

## Milestones

- **Week 1–2:** MVP feature implementation, basic UI.
- **Week 3:** Internal testing and onboarding flow polish.
- **Week 4:** Beta launch with 100 user invite cohort.
- **Post-Beta:** Collect feedback, refine core features, and prepare for broader launch.
